I would very much say that I wouldn't be where I am today without reading this book. The author is a bit controversial, but I personally think the content of this particular book is good. I would highly recommend this book if you can excuse his use of profanity and harsh words."

However, this one was available in the library first, so this was the first book that I've read from Tony Robbins. 10 out of 10 recommend this. The major takeaway from this book for me was finding a role model. Someone, somwhere, must have done the things that you've been dreaming to achieve. You first need to know what it is that you want, know it is possible to achieve with inspiration from someone that's done it, and mirror and execute it!"

The content is actually eye-opening for me. It talks about the different levels of self-talk. Base from what you say and it will show how you view yourself currently, which is amazing to me because I didn't think it matters. Two stars deducted because some of his negative self-talk example don't make sense and I don't like his overuse of computer analogy in the book. "
