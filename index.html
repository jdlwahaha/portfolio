				<p>
					Speaking is such an important skill for our everyday lives, yet I never really try to dive deep in this area.
					<strong>JD Reads</strong> is gonna be a podcast style thing. I will try to find an article that interests me and read it aloud for
					improvements. The goal is set for one article a day, but life gets busy sometimes. Anyways, Hopefully by the end of the
					series, I will have enough confidence speaking to anyone anywhere.
