                        <strong>The Decorator Pattern</strong> attaches additional responsibilities to
                        an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing
                        for extending functionality.

                    <p class="question">
                        <span>Q:</span>
                        <span>
                        I'm a little worried about the code that might test for a specific concrete component - say HouseBlend - and do something, like issue a discount. 
                        Once I've wrapped the HouseBlend with decorators, this isn't going to work anymore.
                        </span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        <span>A:</span>
                        <span>
                        That is exactly right. If you have code that relies on the concrete component's
                        type, decorators will break that code. As long as you only write code against
                        the abstract component type, the use of decorators will remain transparent to
                        your code. However, once you start writing code against concrete components,
                        you'll want to rethink your application design and your use of decorators.

                        <span>Q:</span>
                        <span>
                        Wouldn't it be easy for some client of a beverage to end up with a decorator
                        that isn't the outermost decorator? Like if I had a DarkRoast with Mocha, Soy,
                        and Whip, it would be easy to write code that somehow ended up with a reference
                        to Soy instead of Whip, which means it would not include Whip in the order.
                        </span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        <span>A:</span>
                        <span>
                        You could certainly argue that you have to manage more objects with the
                        Decorator Pattern and so there is an increased chance that coding errors will
                        introduce the kinds of problmes you suggest. However, decorators are typically
                        created by using other patterns like Factory and Builder. Once we've covered
                        these patterns, you'll see that the creation of the concrete component with its
                        decorator is "well encapsulated" and doesn't lead to these kinds of problems.

                    <hr>
                    <p class="question">
                        <span>Q:</span>
                        <span>
                            Can decorators know about the other decorations in the chain? Say, I wanted my
                            getDescription() method to print "Whip, Double Mocha" instead of "Mocha, Whip,
                            Mocha"? That would require that my outermost decorator know all the decorators
                            it is wrapping.
                        </span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        <span>A:</span>
                        <span>
                        Decorators are meant to add behaviour to the object they wrap. When you need to
                        peek at multiple layers into the decorator chain, you are starting to push the
                        decorator beyond its true intent. Nevertheless, such things are possible.
                        Imagine a CondimentPrettyPrint decorator that parses the final description and
                        can print "Mocha, Whip, Mocha" as "Whip, Double Mocha." Nothe that
                        getDescription() could return an ArrayList of descriptions to make this easier.
