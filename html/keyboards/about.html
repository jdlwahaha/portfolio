                    <p>
                        These are the keyboards that I currently own or previously owned. 
                        I am a keyboard collector, not an enthusiast. I don't build keyboards or do any
                        customizations that requires too much work (e.g. lubing switches). Keyboards to
                        me are such a calming instrument. I like the feeling of a key that when you
                        press down, it always pops back up. It is great company to have for my work.

            <section class="box">
                <h1>Switches</h1>
                <div class="box-content">
                    <p>
                        My favourite switches from most favourite to least:

                    </p>

                    <span id="favourite-switch">
                        <span class="linear">Linear</span>
                        <span class="greater">&gt;</span>
                        <span class="membrane">Membrane</span>
                        <span class="greater">&gt;</span>
                        <span class="clicky">Clicky</span>
                        <span class="greater">&gt;</span>
                        <span class="tactile">Tactile</span>
                        <span class="greater">&gt;</span>
                        <span class="mecha-membrane">Mecha-membrane</span>
                    </span>

                    <p>
                        Some of the membrane are really well made. Some of them are not as good,
                        but I personally find them generally more comfortable to type on. Especially at the times when
                        you're trying to do some speed
                        practice tests. Membrane keys don't require as much force to press in comparison to the
                        mechanical switches. Just because most keyboard enthusiasts dislike it, it doesn't mean that
                        you have to
                        comply.
