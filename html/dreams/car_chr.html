                    I finally got a car that meet most of my criteria. 
                    It's about one year after I put down all the requirements for a car.
                    It ticks most of the boxes and let's review!

                                    It's actually a 5-door small crossover, but I like how the backseat handles are
                                    hidden on the top of the car. <br><br>

                                    Sufficient of room in the backseats if I want to take more passengers. However, I'll likely 
                                    keep the seats down because the truck space is quite small compare to what I'm used to.

                                    This is very subjective. Lots of people don't like the look, but I think it looks pretty sharp and feirce.

                                    This model has blind spot sensor which turns on the indicator on the side mirror. It has automatic breaks 
                                    if it detects that the car is too close to the car in front of it. As a bonus point, it also has lane 
                                    detection which beeps to notify that the car is too close to the lines.

                                    This is again a very subjective point. I'm not looking for message chair type of comfy, but 
                                    good enough that it doesn't hurt my back for my daily commute.

                                    This car is automatic only. It has three driving modes: Eco, Normal, and Sport. <br><br>
                                    
                                    The driving experience is not that great. I find that there's a short delay between gasing, 
                                    breaking, or turning when in Eco and Normal 
                                    modes (very similar to newer version of Camry). <br><br>
                                    
                                    Sport mode seems to be doing better, but the car does not 
                                    preserves the Sport mode setting. It always reset to either Eco or Normal when you restart the car.
