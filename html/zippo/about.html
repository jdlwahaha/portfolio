                <h1>How I start</h1>
                <div class="box-content">
                    <p>
                        I first heard about <span class="blue">Zippo lighters</span>  was when I was watching cigar reviews.
                        There is a huge debate on whether you should light your cigar with <span class="blue">Zippo lighters</span>  or not.
                        <span class="red">BiC lighters</span>  have always been my go-to because they are cheap and accessible from stores everywhere. 
                        <span class="blue">Zippo lighters</span>  in comparison were more difficult to locate. The only place where I could find them 
                        was Amazon and that is where I got my first <span class="blue">Zippo</span>.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class="box">
                <h1>My Zippo Collection</h1>
                <div class="box-content">
                    <p>
                        The first one that I bought was the <i>Navy Blue Matte</i>. 
                        The case feels amazing and I was instantly in love! &#x2764;
                        The flicking mechanism is fun. I am not a huge fan over 
                        the <span class="squiggly">"distinctive <span class="blue">Zippo</span> click"</span>.
                        Regardless, it's an added bonus and a fun gadget to fiddle with. 
                        Since then, I have <span class="green">spent about <span id="cost"></span></span> on this collection. &#128184;

                            <li>It is much heavier than a <span class="red">BiC</span> to carry around</li>
                            <li>It does not come with lighter fluid and I have to purchase it separately</li>
                            <li>I have to re-fuel <span class="blue">Zippo</span> myself (simply too much work)</li>
                            <li>You need to close the lid to put out the fire which I don't find it safe</li>
