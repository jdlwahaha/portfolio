                        While I think <span class="red">Exploding Kittens</span> is a fun party game and all, they 
                        could have made the boxes more portable and usable. Most of the boxes (especially the expansion ones) 
                        are way too oversized and take too much effort to open. <a href="detail?edition=party">Party Pack</a>
                        is the only one that I found the case being convenient at all. The rest of them are pretty much for shelf.
                        I don't want to leave the rest of the cards in there. I want to make it more accessible to take it everywhere and play with others.

                        I came across <a target="_blank" class="triggerHover" href="https://amzn.to/3KY4RhS">Gamegenic

                            <span class="showOnHover">
                                Check it out on Amazon.ca
                            </span>
                        </a> during my research on this topic. 
                        I would say that they do make pretty premium card storage! They use strong magnets for the lids and the case mostly made out of fabrics. 
                        They make these boxes come in different sizes and colours that you will for sure find one that tailors your need.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you need some sleeves to protect the cards, they also make those and with variety of colour 
                        selections as well. So if say one of your card has an damaged edges or back and friends can see 
                        an <span class="red">exploding kittens</span> coming, putting the cards in sleeves will help hiding those marks.
                    </p>
                   <p>
                        Anyways, I think it's a pretty nice brand that worths sharing.
