                        I didn't think that I would collect cards. I played <span class="red">Exploding Kittens Original Edition</span> with my coworkers 
                        somewhere back in 2019 slightly before the pandemic happened. It wasn't a game that would catch my attention 
                        because I normally don't enjoy playing table top games and the art is not exactly the cutest.

                        I purchased my first set (<span class="blue">Exploding Kittens: Recipes for Disaster</span>) recently in 2023 because
                        my close friends from high school started playing too. I need a copy too to understand the game fully to win. 
                        <span class="blue">Recipes for Disaster</span> claims to be the deluxe version and seem to have it all. 
                        <i><highlight>However, does it really have it all? </highlight></i>

                        That was basically the trap question for me to start giving my money to <span class="hollow">Exploding Kittens</span>. 
                        It probably just take a few dollars, if not cents, to make those paper cards. 
                        And I've <span class="green"> spent about <span id="cost"></span></span> on it already! 
                         I have to admit that the game is pretty fun though. 
                        The cards by themselves might not worth much, but what makes it worthy is the good time that it brings to your circle.

                                No. It's missing a few cards from all expansion and editions. However, it does contain the most range of cards.

                                It is missing a few kitten art from <span class="blue">Imploding Kittens</span>, but <span class="blue">Recipes for Disaster</span> does have all <span class="blue">Imploding Kittens</span> action cards and you're not missing out much.
