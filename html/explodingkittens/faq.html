                                No. It's missing a few cards from all expansion and editions. However, it does contain the most range of cards.

                                Not regret per se, but you can skip <span class="blue">Imploding Kittens</span> <strong>IF</strong> you already have <span class="blue">Recipes for Disaster</span>.<br>
                                It is missing a few kitten art from <span class="blue">Imploding Kittens</span>, but <span class="blue">Recipes for Disaster</span> does have all <span class="blue">Imploding Kittens</span> action cards and you're not missing out much.

                                Quite the contrary. The art is surprisingly quite cute!

                                It's rated 17+.
                                
                                The overall graphic is not too suggested in that way. 
                                It's probably rated for the level of gross content actually.
