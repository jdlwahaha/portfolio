                    <p>
                        I really wish <span class="hollow">Exploding Kittens</span> could make better boxes. 
                        <span class="red">Party Pack</span> was the only perfect box in turns of the size 
                        and usability. It is easy to flip open and is a fun party singing box! 
                        However, the rest of the boxes are mostly way oversized to store or carry and 
                        are just not convenient to open. 
                        I hope they can make more boxes similar to the <span class="red">Party Pack</span>
                        version so that we don't have to spend extra for the card boxes in the future.

                <h1>Oomomo</h1>
                <div class="box-content">
                    <p>
                        I would like to recommend these plastic boxes from Oomomo. It is very light-weight and
                        comes with a lock and a handle for easy-carrying. It is just very portable!
                        It is also stackable and space-saving. I got these for about 3-4 dollars each so it's rather 
                        inexpensive and functional.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        The only drawback is that there's a inner bump for the lock mechanism that can potentially damage 
                        the cards when you close the case. Therefore, I have the field guide and instructions paper 
                        placed at the front to protect the cards.

                <h1>Gamegenic</h1>
                <div class="box-content">
                    <p>
                        I came across <span class="blue">Gamegenic</span> card boxes
                        when I was searching for better boxes for these kitten cards.
                        

                        <span class="blue">Gamegenic</span> makes pretty premium card boxes! They use strong magnets for the lid and 
                        the cases are mostly made out of fabrics. 
                        These boxes also come in different sizes and colours that you will for sure find one that tailors your need.  

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All that being said, I think <span class="blue">Gamegenic</span> might just be too premium for the kitten cards. 
                        The price tag for these boxes is about $20-100 depending on the structure and sizes.
                        Portability-wise, I prefer the handles that Oomomo has. I believe that <span class="blue">Gamegenic</span> boxes are more for 
                        card storage. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These are not limited to store kittens cards and it was more advertised 
                        towards Magic the Gathering, Pokemon, and such. So, if you have a collector set that you want to keep at home 
                        and only take it out to look at once in a while, <span class="blue">Gamegenic</span>, in my opinion, is the great box for you.
                    </p>
