                        I came across <a target="_blank" class="triggerHover" href="https://amzn.to/3V1zabZ">Gamegenic card boxes

                                Check it out on Amazon.ca
                            </span>
                        </a> when I was searching for better boxes for these kitten cards. I wanted more portable and accessible card storage than the 
                        default packages. Some of the boxes (especially the expansion packs) are way too oversized and takes too much effort to open.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would say that Gamegenic makes pretty premium card boxes! They use strong magnets for the lid and 
                        the cases are mostly made out of fabrics. 
                        These boxes also come in different sizes and colours that you will for sure find one that tailors your need.

                <h1>Oomomo</h1>

                        Gamegenic makes really premium card boxes, but if you are looking for a cheaper alternative, 
                        I would like to recommend these plastic boxes from Oomomo. It is very light-weight and
                         comes with a lock and a handle for easy-carrying. 
                         It is also stackable and space-saving. 
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        The only drawback is that there's a inner bump for the lock mechanism that can potentially damage 
                        the cards when you close the case. Therefore, I have the field guide and instructions paper 
                        placed at the front to protect the cards.

                        I really wish <span class="hollow">Exploding Kittens</span> could make better boxes. 
                        <span class="red">Party Pack</span> was the only perfect box in turns of the size 
                        and usability. It is easy to flip open and is a fun party singing box! 
                        However, the rest of the boxes are mostly oversized and not convenient to open. 
                        I hope they can make more boxes similar to the <span class="red">Party Pack</span>
                        version so that we don't have to spend extra for the card boxes in the future.
