                        This site is a small project written in plain HTML and CSS. 
                        It is mostly written in Javascript and I am using jQuery 2.1.3 to keep my library usage small.

                <div class="box-content">
                    <p>
                        The goal of the project is for me to easily track my work and progress. A porfolio page, 
                        if you will. There are other frameworks that I can use to achieve this. 
                        However, most of them will require extra payments to unlock 
                        my prefered themes. Hence, I've decided to write my own and claim everything mine.

                    <p>
                        This project is currently hosted by Github and all the data are stored in JSON files.
                        I am not handling the data in any fancy databases because I am and will be the sole contributor to this site.
                        Since this is just a personal project and I want to update my pages as easily and quickly as possible, 
                        setting up my own server and connecting a database will add unnecessary overhead for my purposes. 
                        I am happy with Gihub for providing a static url and serving the static data for now.
