                        This site is a small project written in plain <span class="keyword-skill">HTML</span> 
                        and <span class="keyword-skill">CSS</span>. 
                        It is mostly written in <span class="keyword-skill">Javascript</span> and I am 
                        using <span class="keyword-skill">jQuery 3.5.1</span> to keep my library usage small.

                <h1>Goal</h1>
                <div class="box-content">
                    <p>
                        The goal of the project is for me to easily track my work progress and goals.
                        It is built with <span class="keyword-skill">responsive</span> design in mind so 
                        I can view my contents on any screen. There are other frameworks that I could use to achieve this. 
                        However, most of them will require extra payments to unlock 
                        my preferred themes and actions. Hence, I've decided to write my own and design features just for my needs.

                    <p>
                        This project started with <span class="keyword-project">JDReads</span> where I just want to easily publish 
                        an audio recording of an article that I've chose and read out for the day. Then I've 
                        decided to have a better analytics page (<span class="keyword-project">GO</span>) for my videos on YouTube. And now, 
                        I want to expand more to fit more areas of my life and hobbies into this site.

                    <p>
                        This project is currently hosted on <span class="keyword-skill">Github</span> and all the data are stored in <span class="keyword-skill">JSON</span> files.
                        I am not handling the data in any fancy databases because I am, and will be, the sole contributor to this site.
                        Since this is just a personal project and I want to update my pages as easily and quickly as possible, 
                        setting up my own server and connecting to a database will add unnecessary overhead for my purposes. 
                        I am happy with <span class="keyword-skill">Github</span> for providing a fixed hostname and serving the static data for now.
